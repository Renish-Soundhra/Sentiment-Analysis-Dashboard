📈 Workflow

User provides input via:

File upload

Video / Reels comment sections

Reddit comment threads

Text is cleaned and preprocessed

TF-IDF features are generated

Sentiment classifier predicts:

Positive

Neutral

Negative

Results are visualized on the dashboard

🔐 Model & Data Handling

Trained model (.pkl) files are not committed to GitHub

This ensures:

Clean repository

Reproducibility

Better version control practices

The repository contains the complete preprocessing and inference pipeline, allowing the model to be retrained easily.

🎯 Applications

Social media sentiment tracking

Audience reaction analysis

Brand & product feedback monitoring

Opinion mining for research

Content performance insights

🚧 Future Enhancements

Real-time sentiment streaming

Transformer-based models (BERT / RoBERTa)

Emotion classification

Platform-specific analytics

Cloud deployment (AWS / GCP)
